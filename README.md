## Overview
Cerulean is a sophisticated chatbot that learns from user interactions to improve its responses over time. Using JavaScript and HTML, this chatbot is designed to engage users in meaningful conversations and dynamically adapt based on the feedback it receives, similar to A.L.I.C.E.

## Features
- **Dynamic Learning**: Incorporates user feedback to expand its response database, becoming more versatile over time.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Remembers learned responses between sessions using browser-based LocalStorage.
- **Randomized Responses**: Offers varied responses to the same input, making interactions more natural and less predictable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this chatbot, you'll need:
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari).
- Basic familiarity with HTML and JavaScript if you plan to modify the source code.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R-D-BioTech-Alaska/Cerulean.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory:
   cd cerulean

### Running the Chatbot
Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start interacting with the chatbot. Type your questions or greetings into the input box and see how the Cerulean responds!

## Usage
- **Interact**: Simply type a question or statement into the text box and press "Send".
- **Learn**: The chatbot will provide a response based on its current knowledge.
- **Teach**: You can teach the chatbot new responses by providing feedback directly through the interface (future implementation).
